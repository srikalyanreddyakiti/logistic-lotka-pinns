# logistic-lotka-pinns
A study on using numerical methods and neural networks to simulate and solve differential equations in biological and ecological systems.

This repository presents a hybrid research project combining **classical mathematical modeling** and **modern deep learning** to solve and analyze differential equations that describe real-world population dynamics. It includes simulations of logistic growth with harvesting, predator-prey cycles using the Lotka-Volterra model, and neural network-based solutions using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
